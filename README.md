## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-  Node.js 20+
-  npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun
-  Firebase account
-  Algolia account (for search functionality)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandru-tiron/next-ecommerce.git
cd next-ecommerce
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Firebase and Algolia credentials.

```
# Firebase
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Algolia
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js e-commerce app is using [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting), which has built-in support for Next.js applications:

1. Create a Firebase project with the Blaze pricing plan enabled

2. Set up Firebase App Hosting using the Firebase console:

   -  Go to the Firebase console
   -  Select your project
   -  Navigate to "App Hosting" in the Build section
   -  Click "Get started" and follow the prompts

3. Connect your GitHub repository:

   -  Authorize and install the Firebase GitHub app on your repository
   -  Select the repository containing your Next.js e-commerce project
   -  Choose the branch for continuous deployment (e.g., main or production)

4. Configure your deployment settings:
   -  Set environment variables (similar to your .env.local file)
   -  Configure build settings if needed

Once set up, Firebase App Hosting will automatically:

-  Start a new rollout every time you push to your live branch
-  Build your Next.js application using Cloud Build
-  Deploy to Cloud Run with Cloud CDN for fast global delivery
-  Make your app available on a free subdomain (yourproject.web.app)

You can monitor your deployments and view logs directly in the Firebase console.

## Firebase Cloud Functions

This project uses Firebase Cloud Functions for critical backend operations:

-  User management (creating user documents when new accounts are registered)
-  Algolia search synchronization (keeping product data in sync with Algolia)
-  Order processing and validation
-  Transactional emails (order confirmations, shipping updates)
-  Admin privilege management

**Note:** The Firebase Functions code is not included in this repository. These functions represent significant development effort and contain proprietary business logic that adds substantial value to the overall solution.

If you're interested in the full solution including all backend components, please contact me for licensing information.

## Firestore Database

This project uses Firestore as its primary database, storing:

-  Product data (including variants, categories, pricing)
-  User profiles and preferences
-  Order information and history
-  Application settings and configurations
-  Analytics and operational metadata

**Note:** The Firestore database structure, security rules, and indexing configurations are not included in this repository. The database design represents considerable intellectual property with optimized data relationships, efficient querying patterns, and robust security rules developed through extensive iteration and testing.
